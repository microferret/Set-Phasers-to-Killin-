Within the world of electric instruments (particularly that of the electric guitar and bass), there are a wealth of ways to modify your instrument's sound. This is typically done via the use of foot-controlled effects pedals. One type of effect pedal, the "Phaser" pedal, shifts the phase of the output signal sent to a instrument amplifier. This creates a distinct sound that can be very desirable in certain applications.
This type of effect pedal is what I have created a custom design for. My pedal will essentially resemble a MXR Phase 45 pedal in terms of architecture but will also have a togglable extra phase shifting network to shift the phase of the output by an extra amount.
