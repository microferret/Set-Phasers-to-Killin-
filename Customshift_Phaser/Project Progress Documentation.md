### Slight aside
Prior to official documentation, this project was an undocumented one-off that I created without any real intention to manufacture a physical product, so, naturally, there are going to be some gaps in the progress record.

I'll be transparent when I can't verify the exact amount of time spent on a portion of this project.

### Phase 1: How does a Phaser work?
The first step in this project was to determine how exactly commercial phasers work so I could build one myself. To do this, I followed a tutorial with a very helpful sample schematic included (https://barbarach.com/breadboard-a-simple-phaser/).

### Phase 2: KiCAD Schematic
After reading about the phase shifting networks required to build a phaser pedal, I was able modify the original design to meet my specifications. Below is the first iteration of my phaser pedal schematic:

Afterward, I realized I had made a mistake regarding the switched phase and made a correction. Below is a screenshot of the final iteration of the schematic:

A good portion of making the schematic was completed on my off time at school during the aforementioned period when I was only doing this project for fun. When the Blueprint started, I poured more time into this schematic. So at this point, about 3-4 hours of labor was contributed to the project. 
### Phase 3: PCB Layout
Now that the  schematic has been finished, it is now a matter of creating the PCB layout. To manufacture the physical product, I will need to export the Gerber files and order the PCBs to be milled using a milling service such as PCB-Way or JLCPCB (however, the manufacturing process is out of the scope of this design documentation). 
Below is a screenshot of the final iteration of the PCB layout, complete with all footprints, decals, edges, etc.:
